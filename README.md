# Web Progamming Group 14 Final Project
## Project Summary
Our groups plans to develop a sneaker retailer called Sneaks. Our website will allow users to register for an account, shop for sneakers by allowing the user to add and remove products from their cart, order items placed in the userâ€™s cart, and view previous order history. We will be implementing input validation and other security features to prevent against common website and database security vulnerabilities.
